# Particle-cli Cheatsheet
## Installation
```bash
$ npm install -g particle-cli
```
## Login
```bash
$ particle login
```
## Setup
```bash
$ particle setup
```
## Library
### List
```bash
$ particle library list
```
### Search
```bash
$ particle library search <library-name>
```
### Add
```bash
$ particle library add <library-name>
# add a specific version of the library
$ particle library add <library-name>@0.1.10
```
### View
See the source and examples of a library with particle library view. It will download the library and tell you where it is on the local file system.
```bash
$ particle library view <library-name>
```
### copy
If you need to make modifications to a published library, to fix a bug or add a new feature, copy the library locally to your project. It will end up in the lib folder of your project.

```bash
$ particle library copy <library-name>
```
### Create
To make your own library you can use `particle library create` to get a folder structure with all the files you'll need and customize it from there.
```bash
$ mkdir mylib
$ cd mylib
$ particle library create
```
## Compilation
```bash
# by default the current directory will be compiled
$ particle compile boron
```
### Compiling one or more source files
```bash
$ particle compile photon test.cpp library1.cpp library1.h
```
## DFU mode entry
1. Hold down BOTH buttons (RESET + MODE)
2. Release only the RESET button (continue to hold MODE)
3. Wait for the LED to start flashing yellow (it will flash magenta first, which indicates safe mode)
4. Release the MODE button
### cli
```bash
$ particle usb dfu
```
## Flashing firmware images over Serial for the Boron
```bash
$ particle flash --usb firmware.bin
```
## Safe mode entry
Hold down BOTH buttons (RESET + MODE)
Release only the RESET button (continue to hold MODE)
Wait for the LED to start flashing magenta
Release the MODE button (before it flashes yellow!)
### cli
```bash
$ particle usb safe-mode
```
## Serial Monitor
```bash
$ particle serial monitor --port /dev/ttyACM0
```
## Serial Inspect
Print information about the firmware modules on a device. The device must be in listening mode (blinking blue) and connected by USB to your computer.
```bash
$ particle serial inspect
```

## Particle Update
Update your device to the latest Device OS release. Follow this with `particle flash --usb tinker` to reflash the default Tinker app to make your device run known good software.
```bash
# put the device in DFU mode first, then update the Device OS
$ particle update
```

## Particle binary
Describe binary generated by compile.

```bash
$ particle binary inspect file.bin
file.bin
 CRC is ok (06276dc6)
 Compiled for boron
 This is a system module number 2 at version 6
 It depends on a system module number 1 at version 6
